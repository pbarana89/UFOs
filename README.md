# UFOs
The purpose of this project was to create an object that would allow searching for UFO sightings based on a number of different criteria. Using a combination of Javascript to create the script that would allow us to filter the user information and HTML to host and display the information that was being requested, I created a way for someone to insert location, time, or shapes for UFO sightings and retrive information matching that inquiry.

## Example of using the project
Here is an example of how to use the search function! 

- You can enter multiple items to search, so if we are looking for sightings in Ohio, the user would enter oh and hit enter to return the result.

- As you can see this left 3 results, if the user wanted to further limit the information to cleveland, they would type in cleveland and hit enter to return the combined result.

### Summary of this project and future plans
The biggest drawback of the filter in its current state is it doesn't allow for many combinations to be found. In future installments, I would like to add the ability to search for and return multiple states or cities at one time (such as a search for UFO sightings in either cleveland or cincinnati). This would allow someone to gather more information in their searches. Another fix I want to add is to make the filter not case sensitive. Currently all results are all in lowercase, and so if someone searches for something using a capitol it will return nothing. Finally, the last thing I'd like to add is a button that clears all inputted information, so that they can search again without having to manually delete everything.
